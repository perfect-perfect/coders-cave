# Coder's Cave

## Description

This website was created to give coders a relaxed space to progress and share your knowledge as a coder. Coder's Cave has a section to catch up on local news and new developments in the tech world. The other section is a place to make posts about coding topics to either ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss any coding topic. The last section is a live chat to be used as a fast pace way to conversate with fellow coders. This project can be seen at https://pure-everglades-43557.herokuapp.com/.

## Usage

Heroku has some errors with the seeding. It is deployed and works correctly but for the best use of the website please download the code from the github repository, https://github.com/perfect-perfect/coders-cave. Then, change .env to DB_NAME="newsfeed_db", DB_USER="root", DB_PW="your password" and save it. In the terminal type "npm i", use mysql to source the newsfeed_db database, exit mysql and type "npm start" in the terminal. Run the website at localhost:3001. The code is fully functional through the github code.
The website is used to expand and share coding knowledge through questions and news.
