# Coder's Cave

## Description

This website was created to give coders a relaxed space to progress and share your knowledge as a coder. Coder's Cave has a section to catch up on local news and new developments in the tech world. The other section is a place to make posts about coding topics to either ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss any coding topic. The last section is a live chat to be used as a fast pace way to conversate with fellow coders. This project can be seen at https://pure-everglades-43557.herokuapp.com/.
